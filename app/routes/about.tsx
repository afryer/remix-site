      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>I am a self confessed comuter geek, self taught in the art of web. Alongside that I am a husband and father of two boys. </p>
      <p>My hobbies are usually dominated around the idea of go long or go home. Not adverse to running for days at a time or knocking off multi day mountain bike rides just for the sense of adventure and freedom it gives me. </p>
      <h2>The site</h2>
      <p>I have rebuilt my blog more times than I have posted. It has been done in Gatsby, Next, Nuxt, WordPress and this is the remix incarnation</p>
      <p>It is a place for learning, playing with new stuff and generally something to do in an evening when I get some free time</p>
      <p>Like the living breathing thing I am not ever 100% happy about it. Could be a little leaner, tidier, and have better design.
        However unlike my offline persona it is quite tidy and fuelled by love, tenderness and the right and decent way to do things as opposed to coffee, beer, sarcasm and cynasicm.</p>
